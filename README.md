Security research and Incident response continually get more complex as attacks become smarter and harder to find. The idea behind security research is to gather as much information as possible about a threat to understand what actions need to be take to either protect yourself or recover from a breach. When gathering intelligence the information can come from various different places each with their own platforms, their own web interfaces; this results in a inherent slowdown in the research process. Spending time jumping from place to place and collecting relevant information, just to then filter it down to what is import and relevant to your environment to use for response and protection. Using platform APIs and scripted workflows it is possible to automate this entire process into an adaptable, repeatable system that can be adapted to any incident or threat.
